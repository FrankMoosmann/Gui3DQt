 * \class Visualizer
 * \brief This is the base class for any customized visualization module for Gui3DMainWindow/Gui3DQt
 * 
 * Deriving from Visualizer allows to register the class in Gui3DQt as a visualizing module.
 * This automatically draws the visualizer's front end withing the Gui and calls the paintGL
 * method each time the GLWidget repaints its contens.
 * 
 * To create a custom visualizer within Eclipse:
 * 		Choose File -> New -> Other -> Qt Gui Class, choose QWidget as base class
 * 		Then include "Visualizer.h" in the header file of your new class and change the base class to "Visualizer"
 * 		Usw Qt Designer to create your front end, and implement your own paintGL function.
 * As an example see VisualizerGrid.h/.cpp
 * 
 * ATTENTION: If you derive from Visualizer, there might be exceptions if you pass 2 pointers as parameter in the constructor!!!
 * ATTENTION: If your visualizer accesses data structures from other threads, don't forget to synchronize with mutex variables!
